<p>Over the last years, the increasing sophistication of smartphones and the growth of social networks have led to a gigantic
amount of new digital object contents. This tremendous use
of digital images has been followed by a rise of techniques
to alter image contents. Until recently, such techniques were
beyond the reach of most users since they were dull and
time-consuming and they required a high domain expertise on
computer vision. Nevertheless, thanks to the recent advances
of machine learning and the accessibility to large-volume
training data, those limitations have gradually faded away.
As a consequence, the time for fabrication and manipulation
of digital contents has significantly decreased, allowing even
amateur users the modification of contents at their will.</p>

</p><p>Overview of the pipeline used in our approach. It contains two main blocks, a pre-processing where the input istransformed to a more convenient domain and a training block, where a classifier uses the new transformed features to determine whether the face is real or not. Notice that input images are grey-scaled before DFT.</p>
